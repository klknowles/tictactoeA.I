# tictactoeA.I
This is a simple tic tac toe game using artificial neural networks as player 2, and this is my first attempt at an artificial intelligence project. 
The project will surround supervised learning A.I. with the sigmoid activation function and backpropagation and will be made completely from scratch without any machine learning libraries all in an attempt to learn as much as possible.
It is not good code as of yet because i rushed what i have now but i plan to make everything very ellegant when i am finished.
